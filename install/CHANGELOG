*** MAJOR NEW VERSION ***

This version represents a major change from previous
versions. Assume no backwards compatibility. Biggest change
is that the package name was changed from DSala to ESys. All
code is now php5 STRICT and has basic docblocks to all
library classes, public and protected methods for generating
complete API docs. Unit tests for many library packages were
also added. For the CHANGELOG notes before this version see
the tagged version 0.12.0.
